            <p>Serving as treasurer for a third year, Chris is responsible for the society's finances. Now into his fourth year of studies in Computer Science, he joined MUTTS in 2016 to continue an interest in tech developed at school. This year he's looking to keep our financial outlook positive so we can invest in more equipment and improve the service we can provide to other societies. Away from MUTTS Chris sails dinghies, drives powerboats and plays too many video games.<p>
